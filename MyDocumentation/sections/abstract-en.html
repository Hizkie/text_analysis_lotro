<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>

This project is aimed at representing a knowledge graph of the linguistic work about the sources and versions of a literary work, and creating a web page which makes the philological knowledge accessible to casual users.</p>

<p>As useful tools for sharing and exchanging knowledge, ontologies are a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization. We chose to create a knowledge graph that connects some of the characters of the The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring, analyzing their relationships and the etymology of their names.</p>

<p>We decided to build our ontology around the book titled The Fellowship of the Ring, namely, the first book of the renowned trilogy The Lord of the Rings, written by the British author J. R.R. Tolkien. The choice was due to our shared interest regarding the topic, but also to the versatility of the book; as a matter of fact, when writing his masterpiece, Tolkien spent a lot of time taking care of every single detail, names creation included, merging his philological and linguistic knowledge with a lot of fantasy and semantic research.
